Sample application for money transfer
=====================

A Java RESTful API for money transfers between 2 accounts. I tried to keep the application simple.

How to build the application

mvn exec:java

Application starts a NanoHTTPD server on localhost port 8888. 
An application object called RevolutData keeps the database data. That object is initialized with some sample bank, customer, account and transaction data.

To view the tests just run: mvn test

You can open the project with NetBeans


TO DO

Improve application by using H2 in memory database - for the first version I didn't had the time
